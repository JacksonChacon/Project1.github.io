                    <p>
                        When I was a kid I traded my special foldable NERF gun for my neighbors DVD of what would become my favorite movie of all time. I would watch it over and over again for months. As I got older I forogt why I was so obsessed with it as a kid. I would, on a whim, rewatch it for nostalgias sake and came to an important conclusion. <strong>Speed Racer(2008) is one of the greatest movies ever made.</strong>

                        Made by the Wachowskis Sisters of Matrix fame, Speed Racer is a live action interpretation of the classic sixties anime. An action filled high speed adventure that shares a surprisingly heartfelt and nuanced story. This story is presented with some of the most engaging cinematography and charming scores in film.
